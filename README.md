# BezierKit

**BezierKit** is a free, open-source plugin for Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro that brings advanced easing functions to your animations. It is designed to be a free alternative to **axymotion EasyEase** for Final Cut Pro.

Created by **Joseph Smithberger**.

## Overview

BezierKit allows you to apply complex easing curves to transform properties (Position, Scale, Rotation, Opacity) directly within Final Cut Pro and Motion. Instead of relying on standard keyframe interpolation, BezierKit provides a dedicated set of easing equations—including Quad, Cubic, Back, and Bounce—to create smooth, professional-grade motion graphics.

## Features

-   **Advanced Easing:** Supports multiple easing types such as Linear, Ease In/Out/InOut (Quad, Cubic, Back, Bounce).
-   **Transform Controls:** Animate Position, Scale, Rotation, and Opacity with precision.
