**BezierKit** is a free, open-source plugin for Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro that adds custom easing functions to your animations. It was created mostly for fun, learning, and to give people a no-cost option — but it is *not* as polished, reliable, or well-supported as **axymotion EasyEase**.

If you need a stable, professional-grade solution, you should absolutely check out and consider purchasing their product:
